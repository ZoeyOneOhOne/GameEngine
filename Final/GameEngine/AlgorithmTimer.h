/*
This class is for precisely timing how many ticks a block of code takes.
I intend it only for DEBUG mode (enclosed in #if defined(_DEBUG) ... #endif)
Pass the current ticks into Start and Stop around a block of code, then whenever you call Average
it will return how much time on average that operation took sine the last Average()
This is necessary since the differences at the level of precision are too big to use it every frame.
